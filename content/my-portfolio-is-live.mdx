After weeks of hard work, I’m excited to finally share my developer portfolio with the world! My goal was to create a clean, functional, and professional site that not only highlights my skills and projects but also offers a simple, user-friendly experience. In this post, I’ll walk you through the main features of the site and share a few key lessons I learned along the way.

## Key Features

### 1. Minimalistic UI with Shadcn UI Library

I used [**Shadcn UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to build clean, minimal UI components that keep the design simple and to the point, without distracting from the content.

### 2. Mobile-friendly UI and Theme Toggle

The website is responsive and you can easily switch between **light mode** and **dark mode**, making the site comfortable to view in any environment, especially mobile.

### 3. Straight-to-the-Point Homepage

The homepage is designed to be no-nonsense—**my resume, projects, and contact links** are all there upfront, so visitors get the essentials right away.

### 4. Blog (Infrequently Updated)

I’ve also added a blog, where I’ll occasionally share my thoughts and updates as I work on new projects or features.

### 5. Contact Page with Email Integration (Having issues right now)

The [**Contact**](/contact) page lets visitors send me a message directly, which I receive as an email for easy communication.

### 6. Saideep Support: Your Interactive Guide (To be added)

One of the coolest features is a **AI chatbot**, which will be trained on the content from my portfolio and can answer simple questions about my career and background.

## Future Plans and Enhancements

- **Switching to Open Source LLMs**: I plan to switch to **Meta's Llama**.
- **Hosting**: I’ll stick with **Vercel** for now, but if needed, I’ll switch to self-hosting using a PaaS like **Coolify**.
- **Managing Blog Posts**: Right now, blog posts are part of the project source, which triggers a rebuild on every commit. In the future, I may switch to a proper **CMS** or just use **Obsidian** to manage blog content more efficiently.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio! I’m excited to keep improving it and learning from the process. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions.
